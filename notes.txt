    Run the unbox command via npx and skip to step 3. This will install all necessary dependencies. A Create-React-App is generated in the client directory.

    npx truffle unbox react

    Alternatively, you can install Truffle globally and run the unbox command.

    npm install -g truffle
    truffle unbox react

    Run the development console.

    truffle develop

    Compile and migrate the smart contracts. Note inside the development console we don't preface commands with truffle.

    compile
    migrate

    In the client directory, we run the React app. Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.

    // in another terminal (i.e. not in the truffle develop prompt)
    cd client
    npm run start

    Truffle can run tests written in Solidity or JavaScript against your smart contracts. Note the command varies slightly if you're in or outside of the development console.

    // inside the development console.
    test

    // outside the development console..
    truffle test

    Jest is included for testing React components. Compile your contracts before running Jest, or you may receive some file not found errors.

    // ensure you are inside the client directory when running this
    npm run test

    To build the application for production, use the build script. A production build will be in the client/build folder.

    // ensure you are inside the client directory when running this
    npm run build

FAQ

    How do I use this with the Ganache-CLI?

    It's as easy as modifying the config file! Check out our documentation on adding network configurations. Depending on the port you're using, you'll also need to update line 29 of client/src/utils/getWeb3.js.

    Where is my production build?

    The production build will be in the client/build folder after running npm run build in the client folder.

    Where can I find more documentation?

    This box is a marriage of Truffle and a React setup created with create-react-app. Either one would be a great place to start!
